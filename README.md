# Advent of Code 2022  

These are my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code. They are all written in Python and are pretty inelegant, but as a teacher/developer friend likes to remind me, working code is good code -- at least when you're an amateur. I have also included the puzzle inputs for each day as `*_data.py` files (in which I also convert the text into a data type useful for writing the solution, e.g., converting a string with line breaks into a list of lines) and a copy of each day's instructions as `*_instructions.md` files.  

If you're interested in playing along, amble on over to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
